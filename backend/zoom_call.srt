1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
the number of features being added to a language is going up and that's the reason I'm going

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,400
to really call the entire course. Now this is a full-fledged course and that's why it's so lengthy

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,840
but you cannot finish the entire course in one day even if it says 12 hours or 13 hours it will

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:23,040
take time. Now let's talk about Java. Now why Java is so famous? Now if you see the programming index

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,400
the top 5 programming language you will always find Java there maybe at the first position or at

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,640
the fourth position you will find Java. Why Java is so famous is because Java has multiple features

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,240
which helps it to be used in the enterprise market. I mean not just enterprise market it can be used

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,040
for mobile development web development and of course enterprise application and most of the big

9
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,880
companies if you go there they are using Java as their preferred language. Now in Java we have

10
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:57,200
a technology called JVM and it's not just Java we have multiple languages running on JVM so even if

11
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,240
you are working on some other languages let's say Kotlin, Scala, Groovy, ultimately you're working

12
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:07,840
on Java technology and that's why if you learn Kojava it is much easier for you to jump to different

13
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:21,360
languages and I've also observed irrespective of which interior going.
