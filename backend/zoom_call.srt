1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
and I should have changed the text, but that's fine.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,040
It was sent the request.

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,080
And you will get this response from OpenAI

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,040
just taking some time.

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,440
And you can see in this case, the cloud was fastest.

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,320
So we also have done the speed.

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,240
Again, this changes based on your prompts

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,320
and the type of question you ask.

9
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,520
So in this case, it was cloud and we got the answer here.
