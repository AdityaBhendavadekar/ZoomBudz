 After creating our HTML element, HTML pages have two main areas. And one area contains data that is not seen on the page, but is considered to be meta data about the page. And that is the head area.

Now I just pressed control S, which saved the document. You otherwise would see a dot up here by the index.html. So I saved that. And I am using an auto formatter. Visual Studio Code may or may not do that for you when you save your file. If you want that, you can go to the extension icon over here and search for a prettier extension.

Pritier is a code formatter that will auto format your code. But visual studio code may do some of that as well. But if you want to use prettier, go ahead and click install and you can use that as well. So I'll close out that prettier tab. Go back to...
