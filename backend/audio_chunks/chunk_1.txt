 Welcome back, aliens. My name is Evan Reddy and this video we're going to talk about Kojava. In this particular course, which is a lengthy video, you're going to learn everything from the basics of Kojava to the end of Kojava. Now this is not the first time I'm uploading the video on Java. If you can see from last few years, you will find multiple Java, playlist and multiple Java full-fledged video. But we all know, right? The quality of videos are going up every day plus the number of features linked to a language is going up. And that's the reason I'm going to really call the anteria course. Now this is a full-fledged course and that's why it's so lengthy. But you cannot finish the entire course in one day. Even if it says 12 hours or 13 hours, it will take time. Now let's talk about Java. Now why Java is so famous? Now if you see the programming index, the top five programming language, you will always find Java there. We at the first position or at the fourth position, you will find Java. Why Java is so famous? Because Java has multiple features which helps it to be used in the enterprise market. I mean, not just enterprise market, it can be used for mobile development, web development and of course, enterprise application. And most of the big companies, if you go there, they are using Java as their preferred language. Now in Java, we have a technology called JVM and it's not just Java. We have multiple languages running on JVM. So even if you are working on some other language, let's say Kotlin, Scala, Groovy, ultimately you're working on Java technology. And that's why if you learn Core Java, it is much easier for you to jump to different languages. And I've also observed irrespective of which entry you're going for. It can be for development or testing and that doesn't matter which language you're working on. Okay. Which is as well. Or you can learn other languages-
