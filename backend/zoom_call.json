Now if you see the programming index the top 5 programming language you will always find Java there maybe at the first position or at the fourth position you will find Java. Why Java is so famous is because Java has multiple features which helps it to be used in the enterprise market. I mean not just enterprise market it can be used for mobile development web development and of course enterprise application and most of the big companies if you go there they are using Java as their preferred language. Now in Java we have a technology called JVM and it's not just Java we have multiple languages running on JVM so even if you are working on some other languages let's say Kotlin, Scala, Groovy, ultimately you're working on Java technology and that's why if you learn Kojava it is much easier for you to jump to different languages and I've also observed irrespective of which interior going.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 5.04, "text": " the number of features being added to a language is going up and that's the reason I'm going", "tokens": [50364, 264, 1230, 295, 4122, 885, 3869, 281, 257, 2856, 307, 516, 493, 293, 300, 311, 264, 1778, 286, 478, 516, 50616], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.1735288937886556, "compression_ratio": 1.7419354838709677, "no_speech_prob": 0.4215005934238434}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 5.04, "end": 10.4, "text": " to really call the entire course.
