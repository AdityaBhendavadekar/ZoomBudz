00:00.000 --> 00:02.960
and I should have changed the text, but that's fine.

00:02.960 --> 00:04.040
It was sent the request.

00:04.040 --> 00:06.080
And you will get this response from OpenAI

00:06.080 --> 00:07.040
just taking some time.

00:07.040 --> 00:10.440
And you can see in this case, the cloud was fastest.

00:10.440 --> 00:13.320
So we also have done the speed.

00:13.320 --> 00:15.240
Again, this changes based on your prompts

00:15.240 --> 00:17.320
and the type of question you ask.

00:17.320 --> 00:20.520
So in this case, it was cloud and we got the answer here.
