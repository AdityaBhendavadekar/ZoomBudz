00:00.000 --> 00:05.040
the number of features being added to a language is going up and that's the reason I'm going

00:05.040 --> 00:10.400
to really call the entire course. Now this is a full-fledged course and that's why it's so lengthy

00:10.400 --> 00:15.840
but you cannot finish the entire course in one day even if it says 12 hours or 13 hours it will

00:15.840 --> 00:23.040
take time. Now let's talk about Java. Now why Java is so famous? Now if you see the programming index

00:23.040 --> 00:28.400
the top 5 programming language you will always find Java there maybe at the first position or at

00:28.400 --> 00:34.640
the fourth position you will find Java. Why Java is so famous is because Java has multiple features

00:34.640 --> 00:40.240
which helps it to be used in the enterprise market. I mean not just enterprise market it can be used

00:40.240 --> 00:45.040
for mobile development web development and of course enterprise application and most of the big

00:45.040 --> 00:50.880
companies if you go there they are using Java as their preferred language. Now in Java we have

00:50.880 --> 00:57.200
a technology called JVM and it's not just Java we have multiple languages running on JVM so even if

00:57.680 --> 01:02.240
you are working on some other languages let's say Kotlin, Scala, Groovy, ultimately you're working

01:02.240 --> 01:07.840
on Java technology and that's why if you learn Kojava it is much easier for you to jump to different

01:07.840 --> 01:21.360
languages and I've also observed irrespective of which interior going.
